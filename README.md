# Prepnet
Reconstructable preprocessor library.

The concept of this library is to be able to save pre-processes as a pickle.

# Do you ever remember this?
Boss: Hey, what's the difference between the new results and the old ones?

Someone: Well, some preprocesses are different.

Boss: Okay. Let me see the dataset.

Someone: Yes, sir. It's this and this.

Boss: What's the difference two datasets? The value that comes out of the difference is slightly, what's the difference in the preprocess?

Someone: Well, I just don't know.

Boss: Why? The dataset contains a commit idand you're managing source codes with git.

Someone: Even if I knew what version of the dataset it was created from. I would have commented out the details and preprocessed it...

Boss: Hey you...

# Example
